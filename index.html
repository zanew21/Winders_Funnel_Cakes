            <h2>Our Sweet History</h2>
            
            <p>**Shaking cakes since 1985**, Winder's Funnel Cakes started small, fueled by family dedication and a passion for community.</p>

            <p>Our journey began with a single stand at a **church fundraiser**. The demand for our crispy, golden treats quickly turned a simple mission into a beloved family business.</p>

            <p>Winder's remains proudly **family-owned**. It was originally founded by **Ann & Tom Winder**, and the legacy of sweet perfection is now carried on by the second generation: **Tyler Winder, Barbara Winder, and Andrew Winder**.</p>

            <p>We invite you to experience the tradition that started over three decades ago!</p>
